BSZ's job:

BSZ is a boot sector installer, nothing more. All boot sector are ready for
use and can be installed by a single keystroke.

Thanks to the virtual boot sector of 2M disks, BSZ is compatible whith it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What a Boot Sector ? This is the first sector of the first track of the first
side of a drive. It is 512 bytes large. It contains some bios and dos data
(like track number, serial number, etc...) and the 448 bytes left can be
use by some code. What BSZ do is puting its own code in here. The boot
sector's code is run once when you reboot your system with a disk in the drive.

How to do ?

Simply type "BSZ" on the prompt. BSZ will start.
Then, select one of the offered boot sectors with then arrow keys.
Put a disk in your drive (you can chose your drive with 'A' -for A:- and 'B'
-for B:-) this disk can be full or empty.
Now press "Return".
Have a look to "STATUS:", BSZ can write here three words:

'OK ' means that the last operation went whithout problem
'WRI' means that BSZ is write on the disk (do not remove it)
'ERR' means that BSZ encounter a problem during the last operation
      (you should retry)

Press "Escape" for leave BSZ.

When you're chosing a bootsector, BSZ display all sort of informations of
the boot selected. They are:

CPU:    indicates the processor above the one the boot won't work (=will hang
        up the system)
VIDEO:  indicates the video mode used (TXT or VGA) by the boot.
SYSTEM: indicates if the disk can be a system disk or not. (for now, all BSZ's
        boot sectors do not support system boot).
LINK HD:signify that the boot whill continue in running the hard drive boot
        sector (so the system starts without changing the disk). For now, all 
        BSZ's boot sectors go on with HD.
CRYPTED:indicate that boot sector contain decrypting routines. Some heuristics
        based anti-virus shouldn't appreciate.
CRC:    indicate that the boot sector perform it's own CRC. (For now, none of 
        the BSZ's boot sectors do that).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the boot sectors offered:

‏ First One  : The first boot sector I wrote. Simply try it!
‏ Debug Boot : It shows all the register at boot startup. This can help you
               making a boot sector for your own system (not for the others
               because these value won't be the same).
‏ QuickBoot  : Do nothing.
‏ GUS INIT   : Shut up the GUS
‏ SB INIT    : Shut up the SB
‏ Smiley Boot: Display a very small picture (a smile) on the screen.
‏ Time Boot  : Give you the date and the time. (On a CPU less than 286,
               the time and date aren't given.
‏ Own Message: Use BSZ.INI to modify the message writen.
‏ Fire!      : This is what I call a short boot sector intro.
‏ Tetribs    : A bugged Tetris.
